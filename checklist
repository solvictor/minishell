TODO:
	- [IMP] subfolders in srcs folder
	- [NICE] good looking prompt
		* date?
		* cwd? (working directory)
		* user? 

QUESTIONS:
	- how to prevent still reachables from readline without reimplementing it

THINK ABOUT:
	- use trello or some other bs for organization (force victordinateur to
	  register too)
	- 'msh_' prefix for functions we reimplement from the standard library like
	  msh_readline(char *prompt) or something
	- cmdline_t struct for the main command line
	- msh_readline:
		* should be like get_next_line except that it doesn't stop on
		  eof (because bash heredoc can erase after eof, maybe that's an argument
		  for using the real readline idk yet...) but then it won't be able to
		  detect the end of a file... not sure what to do here yet.
		* should verify all read calls and return an error int instead of just
		  NULL like get_next_line does
	- exit code should follow what bash does (not sure what bash does)

DONE:
